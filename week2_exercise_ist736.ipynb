    "# In Class Exercise #2\n",
    "\n",
    "Professor: Bolton\n",
    "Class: IST 736\n",
    "\n",
    "Group Members: ___ \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions: \n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise is designed to prep you with skills needed to complete your assignment this week. Complete the following questions and submit a link to your completed notebook file as instructed. You may work in groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Schedule:\n",
    "\n",
    "While in groups, please appropriate your time as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "     - Q & A (20 minutes)\n",
    "     Discuss in your group any lingering questions from the previous week, or discussion any questions / challenges encountered while reviewing this weeks material. Attempt to share and problem solve with your groupmates. Your instructor will drop into break out groups during this time to assist with the discussion and Q&A. Feel free to discussion concepts, coding, assignments, python tools, best practices, packages, debugging strategies, issues, tips, hints, etc. Use this time wisely! Share info and share tips!\n",
    "\n",
    "    - In-Class Exercise (50 minutes)\n",
    "    Complete the questions and exercises found within this notbook file with your group. Each group need to create 1 file but each individual will submit a link to that file within the git classroom. You can also render the notebook and upload copies if you prefer. Be sure to include *ALL GROUP MEMBERS NAMES* in the file at the top.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The goal of the in-class exercises is to prep you with the concepts and skills needed to successfully complete that corresponding weeks HW assignment. Take full advantage of this time and work together to maximize the learning and understanding. Your professor will stop by all of the groups to help with any questions.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Peer Feedback (20 minutes)\n",
    "    Each group will review another groups submission. This feedback should include \n",
    "            -- positive feedback, eg, what was awesome!\n",
    "            -- constructive criticism, eg, how might you improve\n",
    "            -- tips and hints, eg, coding style, other packages, etc\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Notes:\n",
    "    If you complete this schedule early you are welcome to leave early or feel free to stick around :) \n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "## Resources:\n",
    "\n",
    "Resources to help complete this assignment:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Check python docs for the corresponding python packages used.\n",
    "    - https://github.com/boltonvandy/IST736repo\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "## Professor Feedback:\n",
    "\n",
    "Most professor feedback will be provided asynchronously via the git classroom after class. During class your professor will be focused on observing participation of students, facilitating the class, answering questions, and tracking bugs (ugh ... ). It is important to understand this as there will be multiple groups and tasks. Your professor will work to assist as soon as practical if you have questions or encounter obstacles, but please be patient :). \n",
    "\n",
    "If there are any lingering, unsolved questions at the end of class, please document them and include them in the submission. Your professor will address any such questions within the feedback. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your professor will also offer extensive feedback about coding best practices, helpful hints, python tips, useful python packages, resources, and more!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Grading:\n",
    "\n",
    "Grades will be based on participation and effort of all 3 major components: discussion, in-class exercise, and peer feedback. "
